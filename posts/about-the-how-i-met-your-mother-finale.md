Warning! There will be a lot of spoilers in the post below. Only read it when you've seen the season finale. Here are some of my thoughts on the *How I Met Your Mother* finale.

I just watched the HIMYM season finale and afterwards visited the Facebook page to see the reactions by others. I'm very surprised to see so many negative reactions towards the final episode. It seems like a lot of people hate to see so much sudden plot twists in the end and don't like the fact that HIMYM didn't end the way it looked like it was going to end.

To me, it couldn't have ended in a better way. Over the last season I've been really disappointed with HIMYM and the way it was going to the end. It seemed like everything was going to end happily for all the characters with everyone getting married, getting kids and living their lives together as the "gang". I was afraid that HIMYM would end in such a fairytale way.

But in the final episode, the series writers really pulled through and let the show end in the best possible way. Let's face it folks. Life isn't a fairytale where everyone gets married and lives together with their gang and friends happily ever after. Live's a bitch with ups and (some serious) downs.

The thing about Robin is that I've always felt that she was going to end up alone. At some point in the show Ted is talking to his kids about "their aunt Robin". For some reason this always made me feel that future-Robin was a very lonesome person. Therefor it really came to me as a surprise that a couple of seasons later it became clear that Robin was going to marry Barney. I knew from the start that that marriage wasn't going to last forever.

You see, in real-life people don't often ever really change who they really are. They don't suddenly go from womanizer to caring husband. In the end, without helping it, deep down inside they stay the persons who they really are until some serious life-changing event happens. **Barney** was a prime example for this. When the obvious break-up happened between him and Robin he immediately went back to the person he was before. This is only natural because Robin couldn't change the person he really is. And I'm not saying he's a bad person. It's just the way Barney's character is. After the break-up the real life-changing event happened when his daughter was born. The birth of his daughter was the life-changing event which his marriage with Robin could never ever hoped to be. We never truly see what happens after that but judging from the final "pick-up" scene we can be rest assured he did change quite a bit.

The same goes for **Robin**. Robin's life-changing event happened a few hours before her wedding when she realised she was in love with Ted all along and was confirmed by it when she discovered that Ted went to such great lengths to find the missing locket. It wasn't the same of those moments back when they hooked back up sometimes. This was the real wake-up call. Even though she buried her feelings again a few moments later just before the wedding, the seed was planted for what would happen next. A few years later both she and Barney came to realise what they actually knew all along. That they weren't meant for each other and that they were lying to themselves. Barney and Robin would never have worked out as a couple in real-life because they are as far from apart from each other as anything. After the break-up Robin pursued the only logical course of action. To follow her career and stay single because deep down in her heart, her feelings for Ted still lingered.

The same thing that went for Robin also goes for **Ted**. True love isn't something that goes away after a while. True love is something that you take with you all of your life. You can try to burry it and repress it deep down inside but it will always linger and stay there until there's a time when you give it the space once again to grow. That's the love Ted has had for Robin before he got past the mother's death.  
You see, Ted never really got past the feelings he has for Robin. Not even when he told Robin just before her wedding that he didn't had the same feelings he had for her which he had in the beginning. He *did* had those feelings and he has kept those feelings even through his entire marriage with the mother. It was only after that the mother passed away that those lingering feelings began to resurface. It was then that he was been giving another chance to be with Robin. His love for her was the red line throughout the entire series.

And that's exactly what the kids were saying in the final scene. The reason why the mother was brought into play so briefly over just one season and that we never really gotten to know much about Ted and her lives together is that the HIMYM story isn't about that. It's about Ted's love for Robin and how they finally found each other in the end.

And that's why I think the story couldn't have ended any better. There were quite a few surprises such as the death of the mother (never saw that coming in a million years) and Barney having a daughter. They all really contributed a lot to the story and made everything end in a far better way then I could have imagined at the beginning of the season.

This was really the final episode I've wished for.
